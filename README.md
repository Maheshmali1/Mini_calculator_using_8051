# Mini_calculator_using_8051
This project includes the basic 6 digit calculations of math, implemented using 8051 MCU and embedded C.

In this project I have implemented the basic math functions such add,substract, division and multiplication using Embedded C on 8051 MCU.

Methods used in this project :
1) I have used 4x4 calculator keypad, AT89C51 MCU, LCD Display and Keil IDE to build this project.
2) This project is made with simulation in Proteus Design Suite. 
3) It consist of main source file having various C functions written.
4) Some of the function are get_num() for 6 digit input, LCD and Keypad driver functions and result calculation functions.
5) The functionality is tested using proteus simulations.

This is brief introdution about this project.
